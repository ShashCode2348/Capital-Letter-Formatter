# Capital Letter Formatter
A little formatter that changes how your text is formatted. As of now there are two functions, one for paragraph formatting(this does not recognise nouns that need capital letters, but recognises that the word I does) and another for title formatting

## Instructions

Download the file [CapitalisationFormatter.py](https://github.com/ShashCode2348/Capital-Letter-Formatter/blob/main/CapitalisationFormatter.py) and run it in a Python terminal of your choice. There is a clear text GUI that will tell you how to use it.
